Function Basics II - Arguments
"""

# Write a and call function called "names" that separately intakes a person's first name and a person's last name. It should concatenate the names and return the person's full name.

```python
"""
Function Basics III - Default Arguments
"""

# Now write a and call function called "fave_colors" that separately intakes a person's first name, a person's last name, and **optionally** their favorite color.

# The function should create and return a dict with the full name as a key and the favorite color as the value. If the person does not enter a favorite color, you should assume they have no favorite color and assign theirs to None. Try both use cases.

A sample of color conversions are below. Write in logic so the function can interpret rgb and hex colors entered in different formats such as "rgb_hex((255,255,255))" or "rgb_hex('ffffff')". Also make sure to account for someone inputting a color not in the database.

## MATH

### P1.PY



```python
"""
Simple Interest Calculator
"""

# Write a function called "simple_interest" that will allow a user to find out how much they will have in savings based on their current funds and an interest rate. (Instead of collecting user input, you can directly pass values of your choosing for the arguments.)

# The formula for simple interest is...
# A = P(1 + rt), where...
# P = principal amount of money
# r = interest rate
# t = number of time periods the principal will earn interest

```python
"""
Permutations & Combinations
"""

# Create two functions:
	# One called "perms", which outputs the **number** of possible **permutations** of rolling two 6-sided dice and assign it to a variable called "permutations".
	# One called "combs", which outputs the **number** of possible **combinations** of rolling two 6-sided dice and assigns it to a variable called "combinations".
	# Hint: The formulas for these are below, where n is the number of possible outcomes for one trial and r is the number of outcomes you will pick at a time. The contextual difference is that order matters for permutations, meaning the same two numbers in a different order count as two unique permutations. For combinations, the order doesn't matter.

# permutation formula = n! / (n-r)!
# combination formula = n! / (nâr)!r!
